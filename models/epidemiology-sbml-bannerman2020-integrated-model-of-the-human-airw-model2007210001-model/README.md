# Bannerman2020 - Integrated model of the human airway epithelial cell and the SARS-CoV-2 virus

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2007210001)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Bridget Bannerman; Jorge Julvez; Alexandru Oarga; Tom Blundell; Pablo Moreno

## Description

We have developed a new model of the human airway epithelial cell by deriving the cell-specific metabolic reactions identified from (i) a draft automated model by Wang et al. 2017 (ii) gene expression


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
    alias: model
    manifest_path: models/epidemiology-sbml-bannerman2020-integrated-model-of-the-human-airw-model2007210001-model/model.yaml
