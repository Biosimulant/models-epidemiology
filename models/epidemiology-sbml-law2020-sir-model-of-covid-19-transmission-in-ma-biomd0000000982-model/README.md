# Law2020 - SIR model of COVID-19 transmission in Malyasia with time-varying parameters

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000982)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Kian Boon Law; Kalaiarasu M Peariasamy; Balvinder Singh Gill; Sarbhan Singh; Bala Murali Sundram

## Description

The susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model offers the simplest framework to study transmission dynamics of COVID-19, however, it does not factor in its early depleting trend observed during a lock


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
