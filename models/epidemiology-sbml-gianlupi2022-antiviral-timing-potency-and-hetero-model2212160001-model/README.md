# Gianlupi2022 - Antiviral Timing, Potency, and Heterogeneity Effects on an Epithelial Tissue Patch Infected by SARS-CoV-2

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2212160001)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Juliano Ferrari Gianlupi; Mapder T; Sego TJ; Sluka JP; Quinney SK

## Description

We extend our established agent-based multiscale computational model of infection of lung tissue by SARS-CoV-2 to include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models of remdesivir. We model remdesivir 


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
