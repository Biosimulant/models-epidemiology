**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Faïçal Ndaïrou; Iván Area; Nieto JJ; Delfim F M Torres

## Description

We propose a compartmental mathematical model for the spread of the COVID-19 disease with special focus on the transmissibility of super-spreaders individuals. We compute the basic reproduction number


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
